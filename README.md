# <br> **Case Study: Moneris - Payment Gateway**
------------------------------

## <br> What Is It
------------------------------


### **About the company - MONERIS**


Moneris Solutions Corporation (“Moneris”) is Canada’s largest processor of debit and credit transactions. The company was established in December 2000 as a 50/50 joint venture between the Bank of Montreal and the Royal Bank of Canada in one of the largest collaborative efforts in the history of Canada’s banking sector. Moneris has offerings for a wide range of Canadian merchants’ payment processing needs, including electronic and app-based commerce, and its portfolio of services is constantly growing. Moneris processes more than 3 billion credit and debit card transactions a year, for over 350,000 merchant locations across North America currently valued at $2.8T.1.


**Business Activities**
<BR>Moneris offers software integration, a hosted payments page/e-commerce site Moneris Online, and Moneris Checkout, which can be integrated with the website. Here's a breakdown of the top products and services they offer:
 * Mobile credit and debit processing
 * Web terminal
 * Tablet POS
 * Traditional terminals (most common)
   * IWL 255
   * Vx 810 Duet
   * iCT 250
 * eCommerce gateway

Some of the top competitors of Moneris include First Data(now called Fiserv), Clearly Payments, Square, and Global Payments.

### **Key Challenges**

The business success of Moneris Solutions depends on both the reliability of their point-of-sale (POS) systems, and their ability to work with authorization hosts and payment processing partners such as the Royal Bank of Canada to maintain reliable service delivery and control outages. As transaction volumes grow, ensuring that every transaction is processed in a seamless, timely fashion has become more challenging, especially during peak holiday seasons. Even during low volume times, a one minute outage translates into more than 300 failed transactions for their merchant customers.


Moneris also requires standardized processes in place, to move from legagy systems into cloud resulting in a decrease in onboarding time and an increase in employee performance.

## Why this Matters
------------------------
Payments impact all industries and approaches today and have never been so diverse yet so personal. In other words, payment processing is all about authenticating, approving, and transferring funds in a payment transaction. 

Moneris Solutions recognized that the real-time transaction monitoring and analytics software would give them the end-to-end transaction visibility they required. It must correlate transaction, application and network information into one profile, making granular intelligence easily accessible to IT operations personnel. Real-time alerts are configured based upon transaction authorization and completion times, dollar amounts, thresholds, card types, multiple swipes, failures and decline rates.  Powerful trending graphs, inquiry and filter capabilities also help to reduce full outage and brownout times from hours to minutes.

Moneris has successfully partnered with all major card brands in Canada, including Interac, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, and Union Pay. In 2015, Moneris announced support for Apple Pay in its contactless-capable terminals.In 2017, Moneris announced support for Google Pay. In April 2019, Moneris introduced Moneris Core, a proprietary software used to power its next-generation payment terminals. With Moneris Core, Moneris became the first major payment provider in Canada to provide its own propriety payment experience. Moneris is the payment provider for such businesses as McDonald’s Canada, Indigo Books, IKEA Canada, and the Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers.

## Why This May be Interesting

**``Life is better in Cloud``**

Moneris is committed to the Cloud, both with their own products and with their internal tools.*"Our legacy systems tended to take longer in terms of features and updates, so the idea that Cloud solutions get features firsts, thereby empowering our organization to be more current, was appealing to us. We also could avoid costly infrastructure investments and gain reliability and redundancy when on the cloud"* says Measor, Senior VP, Moneris.

In terms of data migration into cloud, Moneris imported standard items like customer company data, name, address, account numbers, email address, phone numbers, all key payment device data, and work order information.
